How to Add/Remove Floating IP’s to your VM?
===========================================


In order to make your VM accessible from the Internet, you need to use Floating IP’s. Floating IP’s in Openstack are public IP addresses assigned to your Virtual Machine. Floating IP assignment allows you (when you have Security Groups set properly) to host services like SSH, HTTP or other over the Internet.



| **How to assign a Floating IP to your VM:**
| In Instances tab in Horizon, click the dropdown menu next to your VM and choose „Associate Floating IP”
